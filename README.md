## **INTRODUCTION**
#### This file contains details on how I tackled each of the problem-sheet tasks which are part of the Programming and Scripting module required for a Higher Diploma in Data Analysis. There is a description of each of the seven tasks including my thought process, references to my research and my solutions. I have also comprised a full list of references and resources which I used to complete these tasks.

&nbsp; 

## **BMI.PY**
#### - This is my solution to week02 task. 
#### - This program calculates a person's body mass index. 
#### - In this program I surround my string with single or double quotes to differentiate where a string begins and ends (Sweigart 2015, p. 17). I put the question I wanted to be asked of the user within the quote marks. This is what will appear in the terminal.
#### - It is important to use float() instead of int() in this program. This allows for a decimal place in answer which gives a more accurate final calculation (VanderPlas 2016, p. 25).
#### - I originally used int() in my code which calculated the bmi incorrectly because it did not consider that there might be decimal place/float and therefore was inaccurate.
#### - Next I convert the height from cm into meters squared. I do this by dividing the height by 100 and using exponentiation.
#### - Using 2 asterisks(**) will perform the exponentiation calculation for us (Sweigart 2015, p. 15)(VanderPlas 2016, p. 18).
#### - In other words, it will raise the height in cm divided by 100 to the power of 2 (Sweigart 2015, p. 15)(VanderPlas 2016, p. 18).
#### - I used the / symbol for a true division which includes the decimal place or float of a number (Sweigart 2015, p. 15)(VanderPlas 2016, p. 18). 
#### - Now that the height has been converted into meters squared, we can continue completing the bmi calculation by dividing weight by the newHeight. 
#### - Finally, the program prints out a string with the bmi calculation included. 
#### - When developing this program, I checked that each variable worked correctly as I went along.
#### - I have left some print statements in this program and have put a hash symbol # before them to remove them from the final code. This was just for my own benefit when developing the code.
#### - This process is known as commenting out code (Sweigart 2015, p. 23).  

&nbsp; 

## **SECONDSTRING.PY**
#### - This is my explanation for week03 task. 
#### - This program takes in a string and outputs that string every second letter in reverse order. 
#### - The first step of this program asks the user to input a sentence. 
#### - The next line of code is how the program outputs the sentence every second letter backwards.
#### - > Slicing is a means of accessing multiple values in sublists (VanderPlas 2016, p. 33) 
#### - > It uses a colon to indicate the start point (inclusive) and end point (non-inclusive) of the subarray (VanderPlas 2016, p. 33)
#### - Slicing outputs a new string by using parts of the old string (Sweigart 2015, p. 94). 
#### - This website has a good tutorial on slicing. <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_slicing.asp>> 
#### - Getting every second letter from the sentence involves indexing.
#### - Indexing is a means of getting a single value from the list (VanderPlas 2016, p. 33).
#### - > A list is a value that contains multiple values in an ordered sequence (Sweigart 2015, p. 80).
#### - Python uses zero based indexing therefore the first value in the list is 0 and so on (Sweigart 2015, p. 80)(VanderPlas 2016, p. 32).
#### - > Elements at the end of the list can be accessed with negative numbers, starting from -1 (VanderPlas 2016, p. 32). <<https://realpython.com/lessons/indexing-and-slicing/>>
#### - This is what I used in this program to output the sentence in reverse order. I do this by using -2 for every second element backwards. 
#### - Using the format; [::-2] means it will show me the full string every second value backwards. 

&nbsp; 

## **COLLATZ.PY**
#### - This is how I responded to week04 task. 
#### - This program asks the user to input any positive integer. Then outputs the successive values of the following: if it is an even number it is divided my two or if it is an odd number it is multiplied by three plus one.
#### - To get the successive values I created a list and added the numbers to that list. I do this by using a Boolean expression to determine if the number is even or odd.
#### - A Boolean is a data type which only has two values true and false. (Sweigart 2015, p. 32)(VanderPlas 2016, p. 29) <<https://realpython.com/python-boolean/>> <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_booleans.asp>>
#### - #### - The while statement will run as long as the while statement's condition is true (Sweigart 2015, p. 45)
#### - Therefore, by adding the statement 'while numberFrom != 1:' the loop will stop or be considered false once the number reaches 1.
#### - This program uses comparison operators such as not equal to (!=) which gives one of the Boolean values true and false (VanderPlas 2016, p. 20, 21)(Sweigart 2015, p. 33).
#### - The block following an if statement will run if the statement is true (Sweigart 2015, p. 38).
#### - The else block only runs if all the if and elif statements are false (VanderPlas 2016, p. 40)(Sweigart 2015, p. 39).
#### - Using remainder (%) identifies if the number is even or odd. If the remainder is equal to zero/true, then it will run the if statement otherwise it will jump and run the else statement. 
#### - This program uses math/arithmetic operators to perform the calculations. For example, remainder(%), floor division(//), multiply(*) and add(+) (Sweigart 2015, p. 15)(VanderPlas 2016, p. 18).
#### - Using append() will add the new values to the pointed list (Sweigart 2015, p. 89) <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_append.asp>> 
#### - This program will add the values from numberFrom to the designated list which is numList using this format: numlist.append(numberFrom).  
#### - Finally, the last step of the program will print out the successive values of the user's number from the list created. 

&nbsp; 

## **WEEKDAY.PY**
#### - This is a description of how I solved week05 task. 
#### - This program outputs whether the current day is a weekday or not.
#### - The first step I took was creating the variable weekend which contains a list for Saturday and Sunday. I use this variable as part of an if statement. 
#### - Next I needed to import the datetime module.
#### - This allows python to determine the current date information as date objects <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp>> 
#### - >For loading built-in and third-party modules, Python provides the import statement (VanderPlas 2016, p. 66)
#### - I do this by simply typing import datetime. 
#### - Using the statement: datetime.datetime.now() outputs a datetime object for the current date and time, according to the computers clock (Sweigart 2015, p. 341). I assigned this to the variable named x.
#### - x.strftime(%A) will convert the datetime object into a string (Sweigart 2015, p. 344).
#### - Using %A will output the full weekday name as a string (Sweigart 2015, p. 344) <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_datetime_strftime_a2>> 
#### - So, at this point the program has determined what day of the week it currently is, and that day is contained in the variable x as a string. 
#### - Then I have used an if and else statements. As I described in the previous task in week 4, if the first statement is true then it will run the code. If that statement is false it will run the else statement (Sweigart 2015, p. 38, 39)(VanderPlas 2016, p. 40).
#### - If the current day is not a weekend it will print: "Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.". Otherwise, it will print: "It is the weekend, yay!" from the else statement. 
#### - This is how to determine whether the current day is a weekday or the weekend.  

&nbsp; 

## **SQUAREROOT.PY**
#### - The following is an account of how I unravelled the task for week06. 
#### - This program takes in a positive floating-point number and outputs an approximation of its square root without using built in functions. 
#### - > A function is like a mini program (Sweigart 2015, p. 61).
#### - The code of this mini program/function is only executed when called (Sweigart 2015, p. 62).
#### - Functions are used to organise code and make it more readable and reusable (VanderPlas 2016, p. 41).
#### - There are two ways of using functions; def statements and lambda statements (VanderPlas 2016, p. 41).
#### - A def statement is useful for any type of function whereas a lambda statement is used for creating short anonymous functions (VanderPlas 2016, p. 41).
#### - I have chosen to use a def statement as I want to define and organise my functions so they can be easily accessed and used again (VanderPlas 2016, p. 42).
#### - For this program I created my own function for calculating approximation of positive floating-point number's square root. I called it: newtonSqrt(num).
#### - The idea of Newton's method according to the above website is to use an estimated guess for A and then repeatedly use the answer in the formula as A until the correct answer is obtained. <<https://www.math.ubc.ca/~anstee/math104/newtonmethod.pdf>> <<https://www.school-for-champions.com/algebra/square_root_approx.htm#.YEkLyU5xfIX>>
#### - I based my code on Newton's formula; √ N ≈ ½(N/A + A) found at <<https://www.school-for-champions.com/algebra/square_root_approx.htm#.YEkLyU5xfIX>>
#### - In this program I decided to divide the input number by 4 as my educated guess.
#### - It is important to note that the variables that are written within a function only exist in that function (Sweigart 2015, p. 67).
#### - This is something that caused a bit of trouble when writing this program. Differentiating between global scope vs local scope. Local scope being within a function. 
#### - > Code in global scope cannot use any local variables (Sweigart 2015, p. 67).
#### - In other words, a variable within a function cannot be called on outside the function. One can only call the function itself. 
#### - I then used a while loop to continue the equation until the statement was true in which case the else block comes into effect (VanderPlas 2016, p. 40)(Sweigart 2015, p. 38, 39).  
#### - While x is not equal to the user's number it will continue to calculate using the answer as the new estimated guess. 
#### - > When an expression is used with a return statement, the return value is what the expression evaluates to (Sweigart 2015, p. 64).
#### - Therefore, I needed to think about what I was asking and what the answer would be; the expression/argument and the answer/return value. 
#### - I also used the round() function in my return statement in order to round the answer to 1 decimal place. If I wanted to round to 2 decimal places, I would have input a 2 instead of 1.
#### - The last step in this program is to call the function. The function will not do anything unless it is called <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp>>.

## **ES.PY**
#### - This section contains details about how I tackled the task from week07. 
#### - This program reads a text file from the argument line and outputs how many e's it contains.
#### - I have chosen to complete this task using a function. I have done this to give myself the option of using this function again by importing it into another program (VanderPlas 2016, p. 42).
#### - The instruction for this task was to call the filename from an argument on the command line. I discovered that in order to do this I needed to first import the sys module. <<https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/system/python-sys-argv>>
#### - In this case the user enters in the filename on the command line while running the program. This creates a list of arguments that then run through the program <<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4117530/sys-argv1-meaning-in-script>>.
#### - Next I wrote: filename = sys.argv[1]. This means I want to use the filename of the first argument in the command line. From here on I now only need to use the variable name; filename in order to call the text file.
#### - After that I started the function where I open the text file in read mode <<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html>>.
#### - This program required the use of the string count method which allows it to count all the letter e's <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_count.asp>>.
#### - I should note here that I interpreted the task as if it wanted the number of lowercase e's. It was not specifically specified but was written in the task brief as a lowercase e so this what I have done here.
#### - This example inspired my own efforts for my program. It shows how you open a file in read mode, read it counting the amount of occurrences an e was used <<https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-the-number-of-times-a-letter-appears-in-a-text-file-in-python/>>.
#### - This website also describes different methods of reading a file. I choose to used read() which reads in the full text into a string for manipulation <<https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-read-text-file/#:~:text=To%20read%20a%20text%20file%20in%20Python%2C%20you,the%20file%20using%20the%20file%20close%20%28%29%20method>>.
#### - The last part of the function is using the return statement which as described in the previous task returns the value of the expression (Sweigart 2015, p. 64).
#### - Again, as I previously explained a function does nothing unless it is called which is the final part of this program <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp>>.
#### - This is where the task unexpectedly became quite challenging. I ran the program using the file I found on: <<http://gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701>>. This is where the problems began.
#### - I kept getting the following error "UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x9d in position 10533: character maps to <undefined>".
#### - At first, I thought maybe it was an issue with the specific text file. So, I found a different one from another website: <<https://manybooks.net/titles/melvilleetext01moby11.html>>.
#### - I ran the program again and got the same issue. I already knew it was not an issue with my code as I ran it using a test text file which I created myself. This is when I began researching errors.
#### - These two websites suggested that the text files may have a different encoding methods to that of my system's default encoding <<https://www.pitt.edu/~naraehan/python3/mbb12.html>> <<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49562499/how-to-fix-unicodedecodeerror-charmap-codec-cant-decode-byte-0x9d-in-posit>>.
#### - The solution that was recommended from these two websites was to use the encoding switch: encoding="utf-8". This stands for 8 bit unicode.
#### - Unicode is defined as a specification that aims to list every character used by human languages and give each character its own unique code <<https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html>>.
#### - The following website explains that "utf-8" should be used for web content <<https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-encodings>>.
#### - Based on this information I added (encoding="utf-8") when opening the filename which decoded the text file allowing the program to run smoothly.  

&nbsp; 

## **PLOTTASK.PY**
#### - This is my description of the final task from week08.
#### - This program displays a plot of the functions: f(x)=x, g(x)=x² and h(x)=x³, in range [0, 4], on one set of axes.
#### - This was the most enjoyable task for me. We were told that plots can be a bit of a rabbit hole which I have learned to be very true. And I definitely had a lot of fun exploring!
#### - The first step was importing both numpy and matplotlib for using arrays and plotting <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_intro.asp>> <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_pyplot.asp>>.
#### - Next I started having a bit of trouble trying to figure out how I was going to plot three functions on one axis. I got inspiration from this website which brought my thought process back to basics <<https://www.kite.com/python/answers/how-to-make-multiple-plots-on-the-same-figure-in-matplotlib-in-python>>.
#### - I needed to plot an x-axis with a y-axis. So, I put the range on the x-axis. Then I broke down the three functions to the ypoints1, 2 and 3. The x-axis(range) stays the same for all three functions, but the y-axis differs. This is how I developed this plot. 
#### - W3schools has good tutorials on how to plot a line diagram which I found quite useful <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_plotting.asp>>.
#### - After that I looked at line colors. I found this website which contains a list of named colors supported in matplotlib <<https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html>>. Plenty of choice here.
#### - This was quite useful when it came to color coordination and design. I played around with different colors until I found a sequence that I was happy with. 
#### - As I discovered from this website base colors can be called using the first letter of the color. However, there are also colors from the tableau palette and css colors which can be called by using the full name of the color.  
#### - Subsequently, I started investigating different linesytles. I decided as there were three functions, they should have three different linestyles. For this I looked at the w3schools website. Here I learned about the five linestyles available in matplotlib. This webpage also gives interactive examples on how you can change line colors <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_line.asp>>.
#### - It also describes how you can adjust the thickness of a line diagram using the keyword linewidth or lw <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_line.asp>>.
#### - After even more research I began putting a title on the plot and labelling the axis' which I discovered how to do here: <<https://www.tutorialexample.com/understand-matplotlib-fontdict-a-beginner-guide-matplotlib-tutorial/>>.
#### - Then I played around with colors, font style, font size and weight for the title and labels. This website has a quite a useful table of fontdict keys and values that are used in python. These keys include family(for font style), color, weight, size and style (normal/italic/oblique) <<https://www.tutorialexample.com/understand-matplotlib-fontdict-a-beginner-guide-matplotlib-tutorial/>>.
#### - Following this I decided to put a legend on the plot. After a bit more exploration I found this website which give a substantial amount of detail regarding the parameters around legends <<https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.legend.html>>. It was here I discovered how to position a legend and adjust the font size, color and other parameters.
#### - All of this is completed using the format plt.plot(x, y), plt.xlabel, plt.legend, plt.title and so on. This can be found on w3schools: <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_plotting.asp>>
#### - Finally, the program shows the plot I have created. There is a line of code at the end of this program which would save the plot to a png file but you can either show a plot or save it but you cannot do both so I have commented it out of my code for the purpose of this task  <<https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-save-a-plot-to-a-file-using-matplotlib/>>.
