# **weeklytask02-bmi.py**
### - Using a string when calculating to differentiate where a string begins and ends (Sweigart 2015, p. 17)
### - This allows the program to calculate the height from cm into meters squared before calculating the bmi
### - Using / for a true division which includes the decimal place (Sweigart 2015, p. 15)(VanderPlas 2016, p. 18)
### - Using ** for exponentiation which will calculate m squared (Sweigart 2015, p. 15)(VanderPlas 2016, p. 18)
### - Need to use float() instead of int() to allow for a decimal place in answer (VanderPlas 2016, p. 25)
### - Originally used int which calculated incorrectly because it didn’t include the decimal place
### - When developing the code I checked that it worked as I went along bit by bit
### - I’ve left these in this program and put a # before them to remove them from the final code. 
### - This is called >commenting out code (Sweigart 2015, p. 23) 


# **weeklytask03-secondstring.py**
### - > A list is a value that contains multiple values in an ordered sequence (Sweigart 2015, p. 80)
### - Indexing is a means of getting a single value from the list (VanderPlas 2016, p. 33)
### - Python uses zero based indexing therefore the first value in the list is 0 and so on (Sweigart 2015, p. 80)(VanderPlas 2016, p. 32)
### - > Elements at the end of the list can be accessed with negative numbers, starting from -1 (VanderPlas 2016, p. 32) 
### - This is what I used in this program to output the sentence backwards
### - > Slicing is a means of accessing multiple values in sublists (VanderPlas 2016, p. 33) 
### - > It uses a colon to indicate the start point (inclusive) and end point (non-inclusive) of the subarray (VanderPlas 2016, p. 33)
### - Slicing outputs a new string by using parts of the old string (Sweigart 2015, p. 94) <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_sclicing.asp>>
### - Using [::-2] means it will show me the full string every second value backwards 


# **weeklytask04-collatz.py**
### - A Boolean is a data type which only has two values > true and false (Sweigart 2015, p. 32)(VanderPlas 2016, p. 29)
### - This program uses comparison operators such as not equal to (!=) which gives one of the boolean values true and false (VanderPlas 2016, p. 20, 21)(Sweigart 2015, p. 33)
### - This program uses math/arithmetic operators such as remainder, floor division, multiply and add (Sweigart 2015, p. 15)(VanderPlas 2016, p. 18)
### - using remainder identifies if the number is even or odd. If the remainder is equal to zero then it run the next piece of code.
### - The while statement will run as long as the while statement's condition is true (Sweigart 2015, p. 45)
### - Therefore by adding the statement 'while numberFrom != 1:' the loop will stop or be considered false once it reaches the number 1.
### - The block following an if statement will run if the statement is true (Sweigart 2015, p. 38)
### - The else block only runs if all the if and elif statments are false (VanderPlas 2016, p. 40)(Sweigart 2015, p. 39)
### - using append() will add the new values to the pointed list (Sweigart 2015, p. 89)
### - In this program it will add the values from numberFrom to the designated list which is numList hense numlist.append(numberFrom)


# **weeklytask05-weekday.py**
### - >For loading built-in and third-party modules, Python provides the import statement (VanderPlas 2016, p. 66)
### - This program imports the datetime module (Sweigart 2015, p. 341)
### - This allows python to determine the current date information as date objects <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp>>
### - Printing datetime.datetime.now() outputs a datetime object for thecurrent date and time, according to the computers clock (Sweigart 2015, p. 341)
### - Selecting the function strftime() will convert the datetime object into a string (Sweigart 2015, p. 344)
### - Using %A will output the full weekday name as a string (Sweigart 2015, p. 344) <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_datetime_strftime_a2>> 
### - This program uses the if and else statements.
### - If the first statement is true the it will run the code. If it's false it will run the else statment (Sweigart 2015, p. 38, 39)(VanderPlas 2016, p. 40)
### - This is how the program determines if the current day is a weekend or weekday. 

# **weeklytask06-squareroot.py**
### - > A function is like a mini program (Sweigart 2015, p. 61)
### - The code of this mini program/function is only executed when called (Sweigart 2015, p. 62)
### - Functions are used to organise code and make it more readable and resuable (VanderPlas 2016, p. 41)
### - There are two ways of using functions; def statements and lambda statements (VanderPlas 2016, p. 41)
### - A def statment is useful for any type of function wheras a lambda statment is used for creating short anomoyous functions (VanderPlas 2016, p. 41)
### - I have chosen to use a def statement as I want to define and organise my functions so they can be easily accessed and used again (VanderPlas 2016, p. 42)
### - The variables that are written within a function only exist in that function (Sweigart 2015, p. 67)
### - This is somehting that casused a bit of trouble when writing this program. Differiencating bwtween global scope vs local scope. Local scope being within a function. 
### - > Code in global scope cannot use any local variables (Sweigart 2015, p. 67)
### - In other words a variable within a funcation cannot be called on outside the function. One can only call the function itself. 
### - > When an expression is used with a return statement, the return value is what the expression evaluates to (Sweigart 2015, p. 64)
### - In other words you need to think about what you're asking and what the answer would be; the expression/argument and the answer/return value. 
### - For this program I created my own function for calculating approximation of positive floating-point number's square root. 
### - I based my code on Newton's formula; √ N ≈ ½(N/A + A) found at <<https://www.school-for-champions.com/algebra/square_root_approx.htm#.YEkLyU5xfIX>>
### - The idea of Newton's method according to the above website is to use an estaminated guess for A and then repeadedly use the answer in the formula as A until the correct answer is obtained.
### - In this program I decided to divide the input number by 4 as my educated guess.
### - I used a while loop to continue the equation until the statement was true in which case the else block comes into effect (VanderPlas 2016, p. 40)(Sweigart 2015, p. 38, 39)  

# **weeklytask07-es.py**
### - 

# **weeklytask08-plottask.py**
### - This was the most enjoyable task for me. We were told that plots can be a bit of a rabbit hole which I have learned to be true. And I definitely went down the rabbit hole! 
### - I started off having a bit of trouble trying to figure out how I was going to plot three functions on one axis. I got inspiration from this website which brought my thought process back to basics <<https://www.kite.com/python/answers/how-to-make-multiple-plots-on-the-same-figure-in-matplotlib-in-python>>
### - You need to plot an x-axis with a y-axis. So I decided to put the range on the x-axis. Then I broke down the functions to the ypoints1, 2 and 3. The x-axis stayed the same for all three functions but the y-axis changed. This is how I developed this plot. 
### - Next I looked at line colors. I found this website which contains a list of named colors supported in matplotlib <<https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html>>
### - This was quite useful when it came to color coordination and design. I played around with different colors until I found a sequence that I was happy with. 
### - Then I started investigating different linesytles. I decied as there were three functions, they should have three different linestyles. For this I looked at the w3schools website. Here I learned about the five linestyles available in matplotlib. This webpage also gave interactive examples on how you can change colors and also the line thickness <<https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_line.asp>>
### - After a bit more research I began putting a title on the plot and labelling the axis' <<https://www.tutorialexample.com/understand-matplotlib-fontdict-a-beginner-guide-matplotlib-tutorial/>>
### - Then I played around with colors, font style, font size and weight. <<https://www.tutorialexample.com/understand-matplotlib-fontdict-a-beginner-guide-matplotlib-tutorial/>> this website has a quite a useful table of fontdict key and values that are used in python. 
### - Following this I decided to put a legend on the plot. After a bit mroe exploration I found this website which give a substantial amount of detail regarding the parmeters around legends <<https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.legend.html>>. It was here I discovered how to position a legend and adjust the font size.
